# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

This week I worked on the AI! We have three units in the game right now that 
all look different, have different attacks, ect. It should be easy to add armor types
to give it a bit more of a "rock-paper-scissor"-y feel (I want there to be some 
real difference in how units perform against other specific types of units). 

Anyway, I got an AI working over break which is great, I think I have 
a good idea of how to implement all of the behaviors we'll want in the game
and the chances of getting those behaviors done before the project is due are high.

While we may not get around to actually translating JSON to AI behavior we'll at 
the very least be able to show the output of sample programs in the language, which
is super exciting to me given that the scope of our vision looks like kind of an insane
thing to take on in hindsight. 

## Questions

The most pressing issue right now is the clock. I feel like we know how to code everything
that needs to be written to make our game a reality - but it's unlikely we'll have a "shippable 
product" by the end of the semester (which is fine). I feel like this whole project has been about learning
new technologies for us - and we've never known how to get from point A (game behaviors that work)
to point B (a parsable grammer) throughout the whole course of this semester. Now we actually know 
excatly how to do everything to get from A to B its just a question of weather or not we have the 
time to get there.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

To be honest I don't really have any questions for my critique partner - If you ever want to see what
we have Tyler just let me know and you can come check it out / give feedback, but again I'm not super interested
in changing the art style or the "feel" of the units right now. I think that while those things are incredibly
important in a real game they're kind of tangential to our main focus. 

Hopefully, next week I'll have a lot of questions about game balance for you, as we will hopefully
coded up most of the AI behaviors we want.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 9 hours working on the project this week, working alone (Nathan was home for thanksgiving).
