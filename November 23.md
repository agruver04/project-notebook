# Design notebook for week ending November 23, 2014

## Description

This week I put togeather everything else we need for the game engine. Right now we have three units in
the game, which can move around and shoot eachother. Obviously there's work to be done in terms of balance,
the three units all have the same weapon and stats, but I'm going to put that on the back burner and start 
looking at AI stuff. I'm super excited that everything this far is working! I tried to include a video but I
couldnt get one togeather in time. I'll probably try again at some point tomorrow. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I think the most pressing issue right now is to start coding up behaviors in the AI file. It'll be interesting
to see which behaviors are easiest to implement/which behaviors we actually CAN implement. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

To be honest I think this is another slow week for the person critiquing me. If I end up getting a video online 
by tomorrow (fingers crossed), then take a look at that and tell me what you think, but to be honest I'm not
super interested in changin any of the unit art right now so while I do appreciate the feedback making meaningful
changes based on it is probably beyond the scope of the project. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I worked for 6-7 hours this week to get the units into the engine and get everything working there. I know nathan worked on the abstract syntax tree, and we worked togeather on debugging the engine for an hour or two.

## Post-critique summary
