# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

This week I fleshed out the game (which amounted to creating different weapons and armor classes for each unit, as well as a bunch of bug fixes) and created two AIs. I added a long range weapon for the "double", a medium ranged weapon for the "int", and a short ranged ones for the "short". Additionally, I made some of the units weaker to particular weapons than others. After that I coded up two AIs. The basic AI has each unit select a random enemy unit and then attack it untill it dies, at which point it attacks a new randomly selected enemy unit. The second AI can select units intelligently. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

To be honest there aren't really any pressing questions at this point. I think the most important thing right
now is for me and Nathan to figure out exactly what we want to showcase in our presentation, and focus on making that as good as possible. Other than that I think we're pretty much on track. I think I overestimated how far a long we were last week because because I underestimated the number of bugs I'd have to fix this week but yea - that's not a huge deal. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

I feel like I'm starting to sound like a broken record but I'm not sure we really have
anything that needs critiquing. I think this is less true this week than previous weeks though - the
most useful thing to do would be to get everything up and running on Ari's notebook in class and
get some preliminary feedback through that. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 8 hours on the project this week working on the areas described above.
